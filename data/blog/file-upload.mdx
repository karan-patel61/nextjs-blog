# File Upload

A MERN stack application that allows users to upload images to the database. 

In this project, we build a full-stack MERN application—in this case, an employee database—with the most current tools available.
This web app uses a MEARN app template available at [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/languages/mern-stack-tutorial).
In addition, we introduce a file upload feature that allows upload images associated with the employee.
**Note**: This solution does not require a Mongoose Schema.
