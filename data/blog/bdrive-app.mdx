## Introduction

Open Chat is a public chat room that allows users to post messages and images.
The app was built using Googleâ€™s Firebase backend technology
and was hosted using the same database service. Its features
include welcome messages for new users who logged in for the
first time, notification for new messages, and the censorship
of inappropriate images.
